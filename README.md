# Jellyfish Hackathon Game

## Overview

Created for the Jellyfish Hackathon 2024 by Sharique, BK, Samad and Savannah
We took inspiration for the game from [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/) and Google Chrome's Dinosaur game

Use-case was to keep customers in-app but if they run into barbs and more importantly, buy the Engineering Team some time ðŸ˜…

Phaser was the framework

Photoshop and Canva for Sprite creation

Sound sampled from Super Mario 64 'jump'
